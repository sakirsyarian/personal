## Jagojs – Ebook Landing Page

**Tech Stack**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI  
**Date**: Aug 08, 2024

### Project Purpose and Goal
The "Jago JavaScript" landing page was designed to promote and sell a beginner-friendly JavaScript ebook. The goal was to create a visually appealing, informative, and easy-to-navigate platform where users could learn about the ebook’s features, preview its contents, and make purchases easily. The design was crafted to build trust and provide a seamless experience from browsing to checkout.

### Web Stack and Explanation
**Frontend**: Developed with Next.js to leverage server-side rendering for better SEO and performance. Tailwind CSS was used to create a responsive and clean layout, while ShadCN UI provided consistent, reusable components that aligned with the site’s aesthetic. This combination helped achieve a modern and fast-loading interface that maintained high visual standards across different devices.

**Backend**: Since this project primarily focuses on the frontend, there is no dedicated backend for complex data processing. However, integration with a payment gateway and email marketing service allows for smooth transactions and automated customer engagement.

### Problems and Thought Process
The main challenge was ensuring a smooth user experience during the checkout process, especially for mobile users. Balancing visual elements with functional components, like the CTA buttons and the purchase countdown timer, required attention to detail to keep users engaged without overwhelming them.

To tackle this, we focused on intuitive design practices, such as placing CTAs in prominent positions and using a clear, minimalistic color scheme to guide the user's attention. Mobile optimization was achieved by testing multiple layouts and ensuring that all interactive elements were accessible and easy to use on smaller screens.

### Lessons Learned
Working on this landing page reinforced the importance of simplicity in design for conversion-focused pages. I gained a deeper understanding of building a visually appealing yet performance-oriented site that minimizes friction in the user journey. Additionally, I learned valuable techniques for balancing design with functionality, especially when integrating elements like payment buttons and countdown timers.
