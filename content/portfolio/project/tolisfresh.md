## Tolisfresh – Food Supplier Website

**Tech Stack**: Express.js, EJS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL  
**Date**: Nov 6, 2022  

### Project Purpose and Goal
The Tolisfresh project serves as an online platform for a trusted food ingredient supplier, specializing in fresh produce such as vegetables, fruits, and poultry. The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly website that showcases the variety of products available and provides information on the ordering process. The site also highlights the company's portfolio of clients and partners, builds trust with testimonials, and offers easy navigation through the product categories.

### Web Stack and Explanation
**Frontend**: The website’s UI was crafted with EJS for server-side rendering and Bootstrap for consistent, mobile-friendly styling. This combination enabled quick development of a structured layout with reusable components. The use of Bootstrap ensured a clean, responsive design, making it easy for users to navigate and view content on any device.

**Backend**: Developed with Express.js, the backend manages product data, testimonials, and client information. Express was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility, making it easy to manage dynamic content and route handling.

**Database**: PostgreSQL was used to store product details, testimonials, and portfolio information, allowing for efficient data retrieval and updates. This relational database provided a stable foundation for managing structured data, such as category-based product listings and user testimonials.

### Problems and Thought Process
One of the challenges was designing a clear and efficient ordering process that could be explained easily on the site, as well as displaying diverse product categories in a user-friendly way. Additionally, the site required a professional look that builds credibility with both new and existing clients.

To achieve these goals, I implemented a straightforward ordering guide on the homepage, guiding users through the purchase steps. I also designed an organized layout for displaying the product categories and portfolio sections, providing a clear visual structure that enhances the user experience.

### Lessons Learned
This project was a great opportunity to develop a content-driven website using server-side rendering with EJS. I gained valuable experience in designing user-friendly layouts with Bootstrap, working with PostgreSQL for managing product and client data, and building a smooth, informative browsing experience for users.
