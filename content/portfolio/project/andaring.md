## Andaring â€“ Wedding Invitation Website

**Tech Stack**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Express.js, MongoDB  
**Date**: May 17, 2023

### Project Purpose and Goal
Andaring was created to offer couples a modern, digital way to send wedding invitations. The goal was to provide a beautiful and functional platform where users could easily create, customize, and share their wedding invitations online. The design aimed to balance elegance and simplicity while making the user journey as smooth as possible, from template selection to RSVP management.

### Web Stack and Explanation
**Frontend**: Built using Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance, Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling, and ShadCN UI for a consistent and polished component library. This combination enabled a fast, responsive, and visually appealing interface that adapts seamlessly across all devices.

**Backend**: The backend was developed using Express.js to manage API routes and handle server-side logic, with MongoDB as the database for storing user and RSVP data. This setup allowed for smooth data handling and ensured secure, efficient data management.

### Problems and Thought Process
During the development, a key challenge was optimizing the site for mobile users without sacrificing design elements. This required balancing visual details with loading speeds, particularly for images and templates. We also had to consider user privacy and data security, especially for RSVP and contact information.

To overcome these challenges, I used lazy loading for images and optimized the website assets to improve loading times. For data privacy, encryption was applied to sensitive information, ensuring that user data remained secure.

### Lessons Learned
This project deepened my understanding of responsive design and user-centered development. I learned to prioritize functionality and loading speed without compromising on aesthetics, especially on mobile devices. Additionally, handling user data responsibly and efficiently was a valuable experience, reinforcing my knowledge of security best practices.
