## Elgoritme – Tshirt Store

**Tech Stack**: Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Express.js, PostgreSQL  
**Date**: Sep 3, 2023

### Project Purpose and Goal
The Elgoritme project was designed as an online store for tech-themed T-shirts, featuring various categories such as JavaScript, Vue, React, and more. The primary goal was to create a responsive, intuitive shopping experience that showcased different items based on pricing categories. This website allows users to browse products, view promotions, and easily find premium and standard T-shirt collections. The site also includes an FAQ section and a contact form to assist users with any inquiries, enhancing customer experience and engagement.

### Web Stack and Explanation
**Frontend**: Built with Vue.js to provide a dynamic and interactive user experience. Vue's component-based structure allowed for organized and reusable elements, such as product cards and category filters. Tailwind CSS was utilized to maintain a consistent design language, making it easy to adjust the site’s layout and styles across devices. This combination offered a responsive, efficient, and visually cohesive frontend.

**Backend**: The backend was developed using Express.js, which served as the main API framework to handle product data, categories, and user requests. Express was chosen for its flexibility and performance in creating RESTful APIs.

**Database**: PostgreSQL was implemented to manage product information, prices, categories, and user data. This relational database system ensured efficient data organization and quick retrieval, which helped optimize the overall performance of the website when loading product details and filtering by category.

### Problems and Thought Process
One key challenge was managing product organization across multiple categories, including pricing-based categories like "Cheapest Items" and "Most Expensive Items." Additionally, implementing a smooth and responsive layout that displays products in a clear, appealing way on both desktop and mobile required careful planning.

To address these challenges, I designed a backend API that could dynamically sort and filter products based on various attributes. For the frontend, I leveraged Vue’s reactivity to create a user-friendly browsing experience, ensuring that the site layout remained flexible and adaptive across different screen sizes.

### Lessons Learned
Developing the Elgoritme platform was a valuable experience in building a comprehensive e-commerce website with a structured, maintainable backend. I learned effective methods for optimizing data retrieval and organizing product categories, and I deepened my understanding of Vue.js for building dynamic, interactive interfaces. This project also reinforced best practices for handling responsive design and data management in an online store environment.
